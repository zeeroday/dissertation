\chapter{Summer School}

\subsection{Summer school projects}
\label{sec:scprojects}
Summer school is 8 week, 6 weeks in Geneva, 2 weeks in China.
Student are supposed to tackle SDG problem.
work on their idea in the first 8 weeks then go to China to prototype it using the facilities and the expertise that exist there.


\subsection{Summer school teams}
\label{sec:scteams}
4 teams A and B

2 document as they want

2 document as suggested from the coach

2 patterns finded, vertical documentaiton  and horizontal documentation


Vertical documentation, teams who document in a timeline whatever step they do without any label considering this, like week 1, week 2 as you see in the picture belo

Horizontal documentation : teams started to document vertical way, then we gave them a template to document.
to them how they could document in a way where their followers could take a project from them and they started to devide their documentation into litterature, hardware, software testing, brainstorming

We asked a team to document via github.





\subsection{Summer school documentation}
There are around 9 project documented in this platform
we asked 24 student to read these project and write a feedback about it and see if they could pick up a project from it.
Zero project was selected, why ?
first EGO. 
Second: documentation they don't find it useful, there are a missing part of the documentation like the litterature, benchmarking, few people knows how to do the benchmarking and I think this is a key in documentation,  to read with openess, everyone has its own way of writing and documenting and they need to be open for others idea to write
